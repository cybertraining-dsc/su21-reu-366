## Abstract

In the artificial intelligence world, handwriting recognition has become a very established area. Over the years, 
there have been many developments and applications made in this field. There are handwriting recognition systems 
that convert handwritten text/numbers into digital forms, help the visually impaired read, and serve as a very efficient 
archival tool. This research will review some machine learning tools that have been developed to recognize different handwriting styles.

## 3. Datasets

- [ ] Check with professors on whether i still need this

## 4. Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]
 
## 5. Conclusion

A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.

## 6. Acknowledgments

Please add acknowledgments to all that contributed or helped on this project.

## 7. References

Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not just URLs. As we will at 
one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before 
the first square bracket.
