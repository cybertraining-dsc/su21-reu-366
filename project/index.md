## Abstract

In the artificial intelligence world, handwriting recognition has become a very established area. Over the years, 
there have been many developments and applications made in this field. There are handwriting recognition systems 
that convert handwritten text/numbers into digital forms, help the visually impaired read, and serve as a very efficient 
archival tool. This research will review some machine learning tools that recognize different handwriting styles.

## 3. Datasets

- [ ] Check with professors on whether i still need this

## 4. Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]
 
## 5. Conclusion

A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.

## 6. Acknowledgments

This paper would not have been possible without the exceptional support of Gregor von Laszewski, Carlos Theran, Yohn Jairo. 
Their constant guidance, enthusiasm, knowledge and encouragement have been a huge motivation to keep going and to complete this work.
Thank you to Jacques Fleicher, for always making himself available to answer questions. Finally, thank you to Byron Greene 
and the Florida A&M University for providing this great opportunity for undergraduate students to do research.

## 7. References

Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not just URLs. As we will at 
one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before 
the first square bracket.
