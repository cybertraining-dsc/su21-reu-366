## Abstract

The first thing that comes to numerous minds when they hear *Handwriting Recognition* is simply computers identifying handwriting,
and that is correct. Handwriting Recognition is the ability of a computer to interpret handwritten input received from different sources. 
In the artificial intelligence world, handwriting recognition has become a very established area. Over the years, there have been many 
developments and applications made in this field. This study investigates some of the approaches taken by researchers/developers in the 
last few years to convert handwritten information from images to digital forms. Also, it discusses the importance of handwriting recognition in modern society.

## 1. Introduction

Perhaps one of the most monumental things in this modern-day is how our devices can behave like brains. Our various devices can call mom, play our favorite song,
and answer our questions by just a simple utterance of Siri or Alexa. These things are all possible because of what we call artificial intelligence. Artificial
intelligence is a part of computer science that involves learning, problem-solving, and replication of human intelligence. When we hear of artificial intelligence,
we often hear of machine learning as well. The reason for this is because machine learning also involves the use of human intelligence. Machine learning is the
process of a program or system getting more capable over time [^2]. One example of machine learning at work is Netflix. Netflix is a streaming service that allows
users to watch a variety of tv shows and movies, and it also falls under the category of a recommendation engine. Recommendation engines/applications like Netflix
do not need to be explicitly programmed. However, their algorithms mine the data, identify patterns, and then the applications can make recommendations.

Now, what is handwriting recognition? Handwriting Recognition is a branch of (OCR) Optical Character Recognition. It is a technology that receives handwritten
information from paper, images, and other items and interprets them into digital text in real-time [^1]. Handwriting recognition is a well-established area in the
field of image processing. Over the last few years, developers have created handwriting recognition technology to convert written postal codes, addresses, math questions,
essays, and many more types of written information into digital forms, thus making life easier for businesses and individuals. However, the development of handwriting
recognition technology has been quite challenging.

One of the main challenges of handwriting recognition is accuracy. There is a wide variety of handwriting styles, both good and bad, thus making it harder for developers to
provide enough samples of what a specific character/integer looks like [^3]. In handwriting recognition, the computer has to translate the handwriting into a format that it
understands, and this is where Optical Character Recognition becomes useful. In OCR, the computer focuses on a character, compares it to characters in its database, then
identifies what the letters are and fundamentally what the words are.

## 4. What has been done so far in the field?

## 5. Machine Learning Tools

## 6. Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^4]

## 7. Conclusion

A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.

## 8. Acknowledgments

This paper would not have been possible without the exceptional support of Gregor von Laszewski, Carlos Theran, Yohn Jairo.
Their constant guidance, enthusiasm, knowledge and encouragement have been a huge motivation to keep going and to complete this work.
Thank you to Jacques Fleicher, for always making himself available to answer questions. Finally, thank you to Byron Greene
and the Florida A&M University for providing this great opportunity for undergraduate students to do research.

## 9. References

Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not just URLs. As we will at
one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before
the first square bracket.
