## Abstract

In the artificial intelligence world, handwriting recognition has become a very established area. Over the years, 
there have been many developments and applications made in this field. There are handwriting recognition systems 
that convert handwritten text/numbers into digital forms, help the visually impaired read, and serve as a very efficient 
archival tool.  
This research will review approaches taken by researchers/developers to convert handwritten information from 
images to digital forms. Also, it will discuss the importance.

## 1. Introduction

Perhaps one of the most monumental things in this modern-day is how our devices can behave like brains. Our various devices can call mom, play our favorite song, 
and answer our questions by just a simple utterance of Siri or Alexa. These things are all possible because of what we call artificial intelligence. Artificial 
intelligence is a part of computer science that involves learning, problem-solving, and replication human intelligence. When we hear of artificial intelligence, 
we often hear of machine learning as well. The reason for this is because machine learning also involves the use of human intelligence. Machine learning is the 
process of a program or system getting more capable over time.

Now, what is handwriting recognition? Handwriting Recognition is a branch of (OCR) Optical Character Recognition. It is a technology that receives handwritten 
information from paper, images, and other items and interprets them into digital text in real-time. Handwriting recognition is a very established area in the 
field of image processing. Over the years, developers have created handwriting recognition technology to convert written postal codes, addresses, math questions,
essays, and many more types of written information into digital forms, thus making life easier for businesses and individuals.

## 5. What has been done so far in the field?


## 6. Machine Learning Tools

## 7. Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]
 
## 8. Conclusion

A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.

## 9. Acknowledgments

This paper would not have been possible without the exceptional support of Gregor von Laszewski, Carlos Theran, Yohn Jairo. 
Their constant guidance, enthusiasm, knowledge and encouragement have been a huge motivation to keep going and to complete this work.
Thank you to Jacques Fleicher, for always making himself available to answer questions. Finally, thank you to Byron Greene 
and the Florida A&M University for providing this great opportunity for undergraduate students to do research.

## 10. References

Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not just URLs. As we will at 
one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before 
the first square bracket.
